# Notebooks showcasing Vipunen API

These notebooks showcase the use of various data sources in the [Vipunen
API](https://vipunen.fi/fi-fi/Sivut/Vipunen-API.aspx) .

Currently all notebooks are tested to run on the Jupyter Datascience container
available in [notebooks.csc.fi](https://notebooks.csc.fi) but feel free to
submit pull requests that are not compatible, we can figure out a way to
introduce these too.

A pull request is the best form of constructive criticism.
